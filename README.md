Real-time Disaster Alert System

üìå Overview

The Real-time Disaster Alert System is a full-stack, cloud-native web application designed to monitor, analyze, and notify users of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and wildfires in real time. Leveraging the power of Azure Functions, Azure Maps, and Azure Communication Services, this system delivers timely alerts to users based on their location and preferences.

üéØ Key Features

Live Disaster Tracking:  Pulls data from trusted sources like USGS and GDACS via Azure Functions.

Interactive Map Dashboard:  Visualizes disaster locations using Azure Maps and allows filtering by type and severity.

Custom Alert Preferences:  Users can specify their location, disaster types of interest, and notification method (SMS/email).

Scalable Notifications:  Sends real-time alerts through Azure Communication Services when relevant events occur nearby.

Serverless & Scalable:  Built using serverless Azure services, ensuring scalability and low maintenance.
